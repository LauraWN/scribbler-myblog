If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. But existing is basically all I do! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.",
